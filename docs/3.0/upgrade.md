## Upgrade from 3.0.1.beta3 to 3.0.1.beta4

### The status field changed behavior

Before, for the status you'd set the `failed` and `loading` states and everything else fell under `success`. That felt unnatural. We needed a `neutral` state.
Now we changed the field so you'll set the `failed`, `loading`, and `success` values and the rest fall under `neutral`.

```ruby
# Before
field :status,
  as: :status,
  failed_when: :failed,
  loading_when: :loading

# After
field :status,
  as: :status,
  failed_when: :failed,
  loading_when: :loading
  success_when: :deployed # specify the success state
```
