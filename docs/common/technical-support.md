# Technical support

Avo is designed to be a self-serve product with [comprehensive documentation](https://docs.avohq.io) and the [demo app](https://main.avodemo.com/) as a reference.

But, even the best of us get stuck at some point and you might need a nudge in the right direction. There are a few places where you can get help.

## 1. These docs

We work hard to ensure these documentation pages express everything Avo can do and keep them up to date.

### Sidebar

From the sidebar you can check out the major sections where we grouped up similar pieces of information.

### Search

We use Algolia DocSearch so you can quickly find what you're looking for.

### Recipes and FAQ page

We compiled a list of helpful [recipes](./recipes.html) from ourselves and the community and a few [FAQ](./faq.html) items for you to check out.

## 2. GitHub Issues / GitHub Discussions

We are a source-available project and love to use GitHub's incredible features to offer support.

### I'm in trouble ðŸ˜±

So, when you run into troubles, please go on the [issues](https://github.com/avo-hq/avo/issues?q=) section and search to see if anyone else encountered your issue and found a way to fix it.

Try out different queries as each person expresses themselves differently. Even if you don't find the exact same problem, it might give yout starting point.

### I found a bug ðŸ˜±

This is the perfect occasion to open a [GitHub issue](https://avo.cool/new-issue). GH Issues is the perfect feature where one can ask questions, collaborate, reference other issues or PRs, or present screenshots and videos.

The second great thing about GH Isses is that they are searchable and enables self-help for others.

We prefer GH Issues over any other form of communication.

### I have some feedback

The next best way to send us your feedback and ideas si through GitHub Discussions. Think of GH Discussions like our forum where folks can share their thoughts.

## 3. Discord chat

Our [Discod Community](https://avo.cool/chat) is fantastic and it's growing everyday. Thank you for being a part of it.

### I have a quick question

We know that sometimes you just need to ask a quick question and a chat is the best place for that.
From our experience, few quick questions are actually quick. Most of the times the answer is "it depends", and we need more information about the problem.

The `#community-help` channel is the place to ask quick questions. When we have time we hang around there and answer some of them. We are lucky that other community members have experience and pitch in from time to time.

There are other more responsive private channels for our customers that need more support and are paying for that increased support. If you'd like to know more about that, please fill out [this form](https://forms.reform.app/ahahHs/technical-support-request/tk3fp0).
